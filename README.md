CONCLUSION
By analyzing the data, we can determine that the District schools are performing significantly lower compared to Charter Schools. For example, 90.43% of students in Charter schools pass compared to only 53.67% of District schools. 
As displayed by the size_summary table, students thrive in a small to medium school size (up to 2000 students), but begin to fail and drop out in the larger school size (2000-5000 students). 

All of the Charter schools are small or medium, with the exception of one large school; this table supports that Charter schools are better for students or any school that is small to medium in size (there were minimal differences in grades when comparing small schools <1000 to medium schools 1000-2000, with medium schools doing slightly better). 

Surprisingly, the data supports that the less money that is spent per student (<$585), the higher the % Overall Passing:
Spending Ranges (Per Student)					
  <$585	83.455399	83.933814	93.460096	96.610877	90.369459
$585-630	81.899826	83.155286	87.133538	92.718205	81.418596
$630-645	78.518855	81.624473	73.484209	84.391793	62.857656
$645-680	76.997210	81.027843	66.164813	81.133951	53.526855

This is most likely due to additional admission costs that larger schools require, however, that would require additional evaluation of spending reports and other metrics. 

In conclusion, this data supports that smaller, Charter schools are what is best for the student (as supported by the higher passing rate) AND the tax payer (as supported by the lower spending range per student).
